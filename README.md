The sequence of events during the runtime can be different for concurrent systems.
Multithreading provides concurrency and concurrency can cause non-deterministic bugs.
To solve this, we developed a tool for Java programs which analyses execution traces from
different systems. We compare traces which are successful and fail. At the end, a UML
sequence diagram will be created to show the differentiated sequence in the concurrent
systems. We worked on projects which have huge numbers of threads to see the efficiency
and we shortened the traces up to 85%.
